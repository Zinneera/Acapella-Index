# Acapella-Index
Making an index for my story

Hello, I'm Zinn/Golem/AngyZinn

I've started working on a Text-Adventure and am wanting to keep this nice and organized for my own sake.
So this is a digital index for it. Searching terms, looking up things, etc.

If you have any suggestions/advice, please go ahead. I am very new to Python.
